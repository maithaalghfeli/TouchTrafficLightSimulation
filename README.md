# Touch Traffic Light Simulation

This repository houses the p5js sketch of the program my group and I used to simulate a traffic light for the colorblind. The sketch takes in two inputs, the first initiating the intended instance by the experiment investigator, and the second from the user acknowledging the chosen instance. The code records reaction time and accuracy of the responses by the users.
